In prog1_1.c the program is supposed to print out a short message. the user would compile it by inputting gcc prog1_1.c into the terminal and then it would be ran by inputting ./a.out and the message should display.

In prog1_2.c the program is supposed to take in a user input then print out a short message with the user input within that message. the user would compile the program by inputting gcc prog1_2.c into the terminal, the to run it the user would input ./a.out and the program should ask for user input.

In prog1_3.c the program is supposed to take in a user integer input and print out the hyperbolic cosine of that number. the user would compile it by inputting gcc prog1_3.c -lm to use the math library. then to run it the user would input ./a.out to run the program.

In prog1_4.c the program is supposed to take in two command line arguments one being the number of elements the user wants and the second to be the step each time the loop goes around and then print the angle in degrees and the cosine of that degree. the user would compile this program by entering gcc prog1_4.c -lm to use the math library. then use ./a.out to run the program.
